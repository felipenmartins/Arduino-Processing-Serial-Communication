# Processing code

## Instructions
Download the folders to the Processing directory. Each folder contains code to be executed by Processing while the correspondent code is executed in the Arduino:

```
      Arduino                   Processing
---------------------      ---------------------       
Arduino_Processing_01 <--> Processing_Arduino_01
Arduino_Processing_02 <--> Processing_Arduino_02
Arduino_Processing_03 <--> Processing_Arduino_03
```

After uploading the code to the Arduino, keep it connected to the computer via USB and execute the corresponding code in Processing. You should see the reaction in the Processing screen when the Arduino is sending data.
